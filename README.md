## MCreator Detector
#"Is this mod an MCreator mod?" This question, and final MCreator status of you modpack will be answered when you use this tool!!!
The MCreator detector is a tool you can use to track down MCreator mods in your modpack. MCreator mods usually cause issues, and they can be a little hard to spot when you are gathering mods for your minecraft modpack.

##How it works
This simple python script when run in the command line will search through all of your mod files, and look for classes and directories in the jars of each of your mods to determine what mods you have downloaded are MCreator mods. The results may shock you, that's why I also added a final verdict system to really make you feel worse about the MCreator mods you downloaded

POV: You learn the mod you made 200+ quests for was made in MCreator, and is causing preformance issues


##How to use
Download detector.py, and run it in the console with python. Then it should prompt you for your mods directory to start detecting those pesky MCreator mods
